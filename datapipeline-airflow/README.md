<h1>Summary</h1>
Use Apache Airflow to build piplines to perform the following operations
1. Read data from s3 and load the data to staging tables.
2. Load the data from staging tables to dimension and fact tables.
3. Perform Data Quality check to make sure data is loaded properly

<h1>How to run:</h1>


Trigger the dag from Apache airflow. All the dependencies and configuration are setup in Apache airflow.

<h1>Data and Design:</h1>

<h2>Files Involved:</h2>
<b>Song Dataset</b>:The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song

<b>logs Dataset</b>: log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.




<h2>Tables Involved:</h2>
<b>Fact Table</b>
songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong 

<b>Dimension Tables</b>
users - users in the app
songs - songs in music database
artists - artists in music database
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

<h2>Scripts:</h2><br>
<b>create_tables</b>  -- Sql Files which contains queries for creating tables  -- airflow\dags<br>
<b>udac_example_dag.py </b>  --- airflow\plugin\operator -- Main Python script which orchestrates the various execution. Following are the major functions<br>
1. Initiates the DAG<br>
2. Calls the various operators which perform the following function<br>
    a. <b>data Quality.py </b>  - Performs basic data Quality checks like Zero records and null check.<br>
    b. <b>load_dimension.py </b> -- Loads the data from staging tables to dimension tables<br>
    c. <b>load_Fact.py  </b>     -- Loads the data from staging tables to fact tables<br>
    d. <b>staging_redshift.py </b> -- Loads the data from s3 to staging tables<br>

<b>sql queries</b>  -- airflow\plugin\helpers   --- Generic Sql Queries to be used in various calls<br>
